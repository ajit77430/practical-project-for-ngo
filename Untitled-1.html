                    <p>Helping others is the action that permanently reverses back and Dowell to the person who helps
                      someone. It is not only good for others but also makes us happy. Humans are living beings who are
                      blessed with the quality of helping others. It is an act of humanity that spread happiness and
                      kindness.



                      You can provide help to anyone. It could be your family, friend, a stranger, colleagues, or
                      neighbors. Help should be provided with good and pure intentions, and one should not wait for
                      someone to express gratitude or say thank you for helping them.

                      According to some psychological researches also it is found that helping always gives pleasure to
                      one who helps someone.

                      It is not necessary to help someone only with money or by giving someone to them. Sometimes your
                      small actions also speak greater than anyone’s words. You can help people in different ways, such
                      as providing:

                      Mental help: In this world full of tensions and competition, when people fail to get what they
                      want, they get depressed and try to harm themselves by one or other things such as attempting
                      suicide. One can help them by providing moral support and motivating them.
                      Physical help: There are many situations when someone has to carry something from one place to
                      another, but due to illness or other problems they cannot carry, one can help them by carrying
                      their luggage. Blood donation or donating body parts of a person who died is also one form of
                      help.
                      Financial help: We find many people who need food and money sometimes for one thing, such as
                      paying the debt. We can provide them with money to help them.
                      Along with all these helps you make someone laugh in odd conditions; Mentoring, teaching someone
                      good habits, and providing something to someone that makes them happy is also helping someone.
                      Serving humankind always makes us feel pleasured and live a peaceful and happy life. It is always
                      said that man service is always considered as a service to god. We should always keep helping and
                      supporting others as it saves humanity also.</p>

                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/smoke-2.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p>One of our era's greatest scourges is air pollution, on account not
                      only of its impact on climate change but also its impact on public and individual health due to
                      increasing morbidity and mortality. There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in
                      humans. Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter,
                      penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,
                      reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in
                      the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in
                      high concentration at ground level, also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system.
                      Furthermore, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and
                      polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to
                      humans. Carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy
                      metals such as lead, when absorbed into the human body, can lead to direct poisoning or chronic
                      intoxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include
                      principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma,
                      bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer, cardiovascular events, central nervous system dysfunctions,
                      and cutaneous diseases. Last but not least, climate change resulting from environmental pollution
                      affects the geographical distribution of many infectious diseases, as do natural disasters. The
                      only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a multidisciplinary
                      approach by scientific experts; national and international organizations must address the
                      emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions.

                      Approach to the Problem
                      The interactions between humans and their physical surroundings have been extensively studied, as
                      multiple human activities influence the environment. The environment is a coupling of the biotic
                      (living organisms and microorganisms) and the abiotic (hydrosphere, lithosphere, and atmosphere).

                      Pollution is defined as the introduction into the environment of substances harmful to humans and
                      other living organisms. Pollutants are harmful solids, liquids, or gases produced in higher than
                      usual concentrations that reduce the quality of our environment.

                      Human activities have an adverse effect on the environment by polluting the water we drink, the
                      air we breathe, and the soil in which plants grow. Although the industrial revolution was a great
                      success in terms of technology, society, and the provision of multiple services, it also
                      introduced the production of huge quantities of pollutants emitted into the air that are harmful
                      to human health. Without any doubt, the global environmental pollution is considered an
                      international public health issue with multiple facets. Social, economic, and legislative concerns
                      and lifestyle habits are related to this major problem. Clearly, urbanization and
                      industrialization are reaching unprecedented and upsetting proportions worldwide in our era.
                      Anthropogenic air pollution is one of the biggest public health hazards worldwide, given that it
                      accounts for about 9 million deaths per year (1).

                      Without a doubt, all of the aforementioned are closely associated with climate change, and in the
                      event of danger, the consequences can be severe for mankind (2). Climate changes and the effects
                      of global planetary warming seriously affect multiple ecosystems, causing problems such as food
                      safety issues, ice and iceberg melting, animal extinction, and damage to plants (3, 4).

                      Air pollution has various health effects. The health of susceptible and sensitive individuals can
                      be impacted even on low air pollution days. Short-term exposure to air pollutants is closely
                      related to COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), cough, shortness of breath, wheezing,
                      asthma, respiratory disease, and high rates of hospitalization (a measurement of morbidity).

                      The long-term effects associated with air pollution are chronic asthma, pulmonary insufficiency,
                      cardiovascular diseases, and cardiovascular mortality. According to a Swedish cohort study,
                      diabetes seems to be induced after long-term air pollution exposure (5). Moreover, air pollution
                      seems to have various malign health effects in early human life, such as respiratory,
                      cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal disorders (3), leading to infant mortality or chronic
                      disease in adult age (6).

                      National reports have mentioned the increased risk of morbidity and mortality (1). These studies
                      were conducted in many places around the world and show a correlation between daily ranges of
                      particulate matter (PM) concentration and daily mortality. Climate shifts and global planetary
                      warming (3) could aggravate the situation. Besides, increased hospitalization (an index of
                      morbidity) has been registered among the elderly and susceptible individuals for specific reasons.
                      Fine and ultrafine particulate matter seems to be associated with more serious illnesses (6), as
                      it can invade the deepest parts of the airways and more easily reach the bloodstream.

                      Air pollution mainly affects those living in large urban areas, where road emissions contribute
                      the most to the degradation of air quality. There is also a danger of industrial accidents, where
                      the spread of a toxic fog can be fatal to the populations of the surrounding areas. The dispersion
                      of pollutants is determined by many parameters, most notably atmospheric stability and wind (6).

                      In developing countries (7), the problem is more serious due to overpopulation and uncontrolled
                      urbanization along with the development of industrialization. This leads to poor air quality,
                      especially in countries with social disparities and a lack of information on sustainable
                      management of the environment. The use of fuels such as wood fuel or solid fuel for domestic needs
                      due to low incomes exposes people to bad-quality, polluted air at home. It is of note that three
                      billion people around the world are using the above sources of energy for their daily heating and
                      cooking needs (8). In developing countries, the women of the household seem to carry the highest
                      risk for disease development due to their longer duration exposure to the indoor air pollution (8,
                      9). Due to its fast industrial development and overpopulation, China is one of the Asian countries
                      confronting serious air pollution problems (10, 11). The lung cancer mortality observed in China
                      is associated with fine particles (12). As stated already, long-term exposure is associated with
                      deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system (3, 5). However, it is interesting to note that
                      cardiovascular diseases have mostly been observed in developed and high-income countries rather
                      than in the developing low-income countries exposed highly to air pollution (13). Extreme air
                      pollution is recorded in India, where the air quality reaches hazardous levels. New Delhi is one
                      of the more polluted cities in India. Flights in and out of New Delhi International Airport are
                      often canceled due to the reduced visibility associated with air pollution. Pollution is occurring
                      both in urban and rural areas in India due to the fast industrialization, urbanization, and rise
                      in use of motorcycle transportation. Nevertheless, biomass combustion associated with heating and
                      cooking needs and practices is a major source of household air pollution in India and in Nepal
                      (14, 15). There is spatial heterogeneity in India, as areas with diverse climatological conditions
                      and population and education levels generate different indoor air qualities, with higher PM2.5
                      observed in North Indian states (557–601 μg/m3) compared to the Southern States (183–214 μg/m3)
                      (16, 17). The cold climate of the North Indian areas may be the main reason for this, as longer
                      periods at home and more heating are necessary compared to in the tropical climate of Southern
                      India. Household air pollution in India is associated with major health effects, especially in
                      women and young children, who stay indoors for longer periods. Chronic obstructive respiratory
                      disease (CORD) and lung cancer are mostly observed in women, while acute lower respiratory disease
                      is seen in young children under 5 years of age (18).

                      Accumulation of air pollution, especially sulfur dioxide and smoke, reaching 1,500 mg/m3, resulted
                      in an increase in the number of deaths (4,000 deaths) in December 1952 in London and in 1963 in
                      New York City (400 deaths) (19). An association of pollution with mortality was reported on the
                      basis of monitoring of outdoor pollution in six US metropolitan cities (20). In every case, it
                      seems that mortality was closely related to the levels of fine, inhalable, and sulfate particles
                      more than with the levels of total particulate pollution, aerosol acidity, sulfur dioxide, or
                      nitrogen dioxide (20).

                      Furthermore, extremely high levels of pollution are reported in Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro,
                      followed by Milan, Ankara, Melbourne, Tokyo, and Moscow (19).

                      Based on the magnitude of the public health impact, it is certain that different kinds of
                      interventions should be taken into account. Success and effectiveness in controlling air
                      pollution, specifically at the local level, have been reported. Adequate technological means are
                      applied considering the source and the nature of the emission as well as its impact on health and
                      the environment. The importance of point sources and non-point sources of air pollution control is
                      reported by Schwela and Köth-Jahr (21). Without a doubt, a detailed emission inventory must record
                      all sources in a given area. Beyond considering the above sources and their nature, topography and
                      meteorology should also be considered, as stated previously. Assessment of the control policies
                      and methods is often extrapolated from the local to the regional and then to the global scale. Air
                      pollution may be dispersed and transported from one region to another area located far away. Air
                      pollution management means the reduction to acceptable levels or possible elimination of air
                      pollutants whose presence in the air affects our health or the environmental ecosystem. Private
                      and governmental entities and authorities implement actions to ensure the air quality (22). Air
                      quality standards and guidelines were adopted for the different pollutants by the WHO and EPA as a
                      tool for the management of air quality (1, 23). These standards have to be compared to the
                      emissions inventory standards by causal analysis and dispersion modeling in order to reveal the
                      problematic areas (24). Inventories are generally based on a combination of direct measurements
                      and emissions modeling (24).

                      As an example, we state here the control measures at the source through the use of catalytic
                      converters in cars. These are devices that turn the pollutants and toxic gases produced from
                      combustion engines into less-toxic pollutants by catalysis through redox reactions (25). In
                      Greece, the use of private cars was restricted by tracking their license plates in order to reduce
                      traffic congestion during rush hour (25).

                      Concerning industrial emissions, collectors and closed systems can keep the air pollution to the
                      minimal standards imposed by legislation (26).

                      Current strategies to improve air quality require an estimation of the economic value of the
                      benefits gained from proposed programs. These proposed programs by public authorities, and
                      directives are issued with guidelines to be respected.

                      In Europe, air quality limit values AQLVs (Air Quality Limit Values) are issued for setting off
                      planning claims (27). In the USA, the NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) establish the
                      national air quality limit values (27). While both standards and directives are based on different
                      mechanisms, significant success has been achieved in the reduction of overall emissions and
                      associated health and environmental effects (27). The European Directive identifies geographical
                      areas of risk exposure as monitoring/assessment zones to record the emission sources and levels of
                      air pollution (27), whereas the USA establishes global geographical air quality criteria according
                      to the severity of their air quality problem and records all sources of the pollutants and their
                      precursors (27).

                      In this vein, funds have been financing, directly or indirectly, projects related to air quality
                      along with the technical infrastructure to maintain good air quality. These plans focus on an
                      inventory of databases from air quality environmental planning awareness campaigns. Moreover,
                      pollution measures of air emissions may be taken for vehicles, machines, and industries in urban
                      areas.

                      Technological innovation can only be successful if it is able to meet the needs of society. In
                      this sense, technology must reflect the decision-making practices and procedures of those involved
                      in risk assessment and evaluation and act as a facilitator in providing information and
                      assessments to enable decision makers to make the best decisions possible. Summarizing the
                      aforementioned in order to design an effective air quality control strategy, several aspects must
                      be considered: environmental factors and ambient air quality conditions, engineering factors and
                      air pollutant characteristics, and finally, economic operating costs for technological improvement
                      and administrative and legal costs. Considering the economic factor, competitiveness through
                      neoliberal concepts is offering a solution to environmental problems (22).

                      The development of environmental governance, along with technological progress, has initiated the
                      deployment of a dialogue. Environmental politics has created objections and points of opposition
                      between different political parties, scientists, media, and governmental and non-governmental
                      organizations (22). Radical environmental activism actions and movements have been created (22).
                      The rise of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) are many times examined as
                      to whether and in which way they have influenced means of communication and social movements such
                      as activism (28). Since the 1990s, the term “digital activism” has been used increasingly and in
                      many different disciplines (29). Nowadays, multiple digital technologies can be used to produce a
                      digital activism outcome on environmental issues. More specifically, devices with online
                      capabilities such as computers or mobile phones are being used as a way to pursue change in
                      political and social affairs (30).

                      In the present paper, we focus on the sources of environmental pollution in relation to public
                      health and propose some solutions and interventions that may be of interest to environmental
                      legislators and decision makers.

                      Sources of Exposure
                      It is known that the majority of environmental pollutants are emitted through large-scale human
                      activities such as the use of industrial machinery, power-producing stations, combustion engines,
                      and cars. Because these activities are performed at such a large scale, they are by far the major
                      contributors to air pollution, with cars estimated to be responsible for approximately 80% of
                      today's pollution (31). Some other human activities are also influencing our environment to a
                      lesser extent, such as field cultivation techniques, gas stations, fuel tanks heaters, and
                      cleaning procedures (32), as well as several natural sources, such as volcanic and soil eruptions
                      and forest fires.

                      The classification of air pollutants is based mainly on the sources producing pollution.
                      Therefore, it is worth mentioning the four main sources, following the classification system:
                      Major sources, Area sources, Mobile sources, and Natural sources.

                      Major sources include the emission of pollutants from power stations, refineries, and
                      petrochemicals, the chemical and fertilizer industries, metallurgical and other industrial plants,
                      and, finally, municipal incineration.

                      Indoor area sources include domestic cleaning activities, dry cleaners, printing shops, and petrol
                      stations.

                      Mobile sources include automobiles, cars, railways, airways, and other types of vehicles.

                      Finally, natural sources include, as stated previously, physical disasters (33) such as forest
                      fire, volcanic erosion, dust storms, and agricultural burning.

                      However, many classification systems have been proposed. Another type of classification is a
                      grouping according to the recipient of the pollution, as follows:

                      Air pollution is determined as the presence of pollutants in the air in large quantities for long
                      periods. Air pollutants are dispersed particles, hydrocarbons, CO, CO2, NO, NO2, SO3, etc.

                      Water pollution is organic and inorganic charge and biological charge (10) at high levels that
                      affect the water quality (34, 35).

                      Soil pollution occurs through the release of chemicals or the disposal of wastes, such as heavy
                      metals, hydrocarbons, and pesticides.

                      Air pollution can influence the quality of soil and water bodies by polluting precipitation,
                      falling into water and soil environments (34, 36). Notably, the chemistry of the soil can be
                      amended due to acid precipitation by affecting plants, cultures, and water quality (37). Moreover,
                      movement of heavy metals is favored by soil acidity, and metals are so then moving into the watery
                      environment. It is known that heavy metals such as aluminum are noxious to wildlife and fishes.
                      Soil quality seems to be of importance, as soils with low calcium carbonate levels are at
                      increased jeopardy from acid rain. Over and above rain, snow and particulate matter drip into
                      watery ' bodies (36, 38).

                      Lastly, pollution is classified following type of origin:

                      Radioactive and nuclear pollution, releasing radioactive and nuclear pollutants into water, air,
                      and soil during nuclear explosions and accidents, from nuclear weapons, and through handling or
                      disposal of radioactive sewage.

                      Radioactive materials can contaminate surface water bodies and, being noxious to the environment,
                      plants, animals, and humans. It is known that several radioactive substances such as radium and
                      uranium concentrate in the bones and can cause cancers (38, 39).

                      Noise pollution is produced by machines, vehicles, traffic noises, and musical installations that
                      are harmful to our hearing.

                      The World Health Organization introduced the term DALYs. The DALYs for a disease or health
                      condition is defined as the sum of the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the
                      population and the Years Lost due to Disability (YLD) for people living with the health condition
                      or its consequences (39). In Europe, air pollution is the main cause of disability-adjusted life
                      years lost (DALYs), followed by noise pollution. The potential relationships of noise and air
                      pollution with health have been studied (40). The study found that DALYs related to noise were
                      more important than those related to air pollution, as the effects of environmental noise on
                      cardiovascular disease were independent of air pollution (40). Environmental noise should be
                      counted as an independent public health risk (40).

                      Environmental pollution occurs when changes in the physical, chemical, or biological constituents
                      of the environment (air masses, temperature, climate, etc.) are produced.

                      Pollutants harm our environment either by increasing levels above normal or by introducing harmful
                      toxic substances. Primary pollutants are directly produced from the above sources, and secondary
                      pollutants are emitted as by-products of the primary ones. Pollutants can be biodegradable or
                      non-biodegradable and of natural origin or anthropogenic, as stated previously. Moreover, their
                      origin can be a unique source (point-source) or dispersed sources.

                      Pollutants have differences in physical and chemical properties, explaining the discrepancy in
                      their capacity for producing toxic effects. As an example, we state here that aerosol compounds
                      (41–43) have a greater toxicity than gaseous compounds due to their tiny size (solid or liquid) in
                      the atmosphere; they have a greater penetration capacity. Gaseous compounds are eliminated more
                      easily by our respiratory system (41). These particles are able to damage lungs and can even enter
                      the bloodstream (41), leading to the premature deaths of millions of people yearly. Moreover, the
                      aerosol acidity ([H+]) seems to considerably enhance the production of secondary organic aerosols
                      (SOA), but this last aspect is not supported by other scientific teams (38).

                      Climate and Pollution
                      Air pollution and climate change are closely related. Climate is the other side of the same coin
                      that reduces the quality of our Earth (44). Pollutants such as black carbon, methane, tropospheric
                      ozone, and aerosols affect the amount of incoming sunlight. As a result, the temperature of the
                      Earth is increasing, resulting in the melting of ice, icebergs, and glaciers.

                      In this vein, climatic changes will affect the incidence and prevalence of both residual and
                      imported infections in Europe. Climate and weather affect the duration, timing, and intensity of
                      outbreaks strongly and change the map of infectious diseases in the globe (45).
                      Mosquito-transmitted parasitic or viral diseases are extremely climate-sensitive, as warming
                      firstly shortens the pathogen incubation period and secondly shifts the geographic map of the
                      vector. Similarly, water-warming following climate changes leads to a high incidence of waterborne
                      infections. Recently, in Europe, eradicated diseases seem to be emerging due to the migration of
                      population, for example, cholera, poliomyelitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and malaria (46).

                      The spread of epidemics is associated with natural climate disasters and storms, which seem to
                      occur more frequently nowadays (47). Malnutrition and disequilibration of the immune system are
                      also associated with the emerging infections affecting public health (48).

                      The Chikungunya virus “took the airplane” from the Indian Ocean to Europe, as outbreaks of the
                      disease were registered in Italy (49) as well as autochthonous cases in France (50).

                      An increase in cryptosporidiosis in the United Kingdom and in the Czech Republic seems to have
                      occurred following flooding (36, 51).

                      As stated previously, aerosols compounds are tiny in size and considerably affect the climate.
                      They are able to dissipate sunlight (the albedo phenomenon) by dispersing a quarter of the sun's
                      rays back to space and have cooled the global temperature over the last 30 years (52).

                      Air Pollutants
                      The World Health Organization (WHO) reports on six major air pollutants, namely particle
                      pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. Air
                      pollution can have a disastrous effect on all components of the environment, including
                      groundwater, soil, and air. Additionally, it poses a serious threat to living organisms. In this
                      vein, our interest is mainly to focus on these pollutants, as they are related to more extensive
                      and severe problems in human health and environmental impact. Acid rain, global warming, the
                      greenhouse effect, and climate changes have an important ecological impact on air pollution (53).

                      Particulate Matter (PM) and Health
                      Studies have shown a relationship between particulate matter (PM) and adverse health effects,
                      focusing on either short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) PM exposure.

                      Particulate matter (PM) is usually formed in the atmosphere as a result of chemical reactions
                      between the different pollutants. The penetration of particles is closely dependent on their size
                      (53). Particulate Matter (PM) was defined as a term for particles by the United States
                      Environmental Protection Agency (54). Particulate matter (PM) pollution includes particles with
                      diameters of 10 micrometers (μm) or smaller, called PM10, and extremely fine particles with
                      diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers (μm) and smaller.

                      Particulate matter contains tiny liquid or solid droplets that can be inhaled and cause serious
                      health effects (55). Particles 10 μm in diameter (PM10) after inhalation can invade the lungs and
                      even reach the bloodstream. Fine particles, PM2.5, pose a greater risk to health (6, 56) (Table
                      1). TABLE 1 www.frontiersin.org Table 1. Penetrability according to particle size. Multiple
                      epidemiological studies have been performed on the health effects of PM. A positive relation was
                      shown between both short-term and long-term exposures of PM2.5 and acute nasopharyngitis (56).
                      In addition, long-term exposure to PM for years was found to be related to cardiovascular
                      diseases and infant mortality. Those studies depend on PM2.5 monitors and are restricted in
                      terms of study area or city area due to a lack of spatially resolved daily PM2.5 concentration
                      data and, in this way, are not representative of the entire population. Following a recent
                      epidemiological study by the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard School of Public
                      Health (Boston, MA) (57), it was reported that, as PM2.5 concentrations vary spatially, an
                      exposure error (Berkson error) seems to be produced, and the relative magnitudes of the short-
                      and long-term effects are not yet completely elucidated. The team developed a PM2.5 exposure
                      model based on remote sensing data for assessing short- and long-term human exposures (57). This
                      model permits spatial resolution in short-term effects plus the assessment of long-term effects
                      in the whole population. Moreover, respiratory diseases and affection of the immune system are
                      registered as long-term chronic effects (58). It is worth noting that people with asthma,
                      pneumonia, diabetes, and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are especially susceptible and
                      vulnerable to the effects of PM. PM2.5, followed by PM10, are strongly associated with diverse
                      respiratory system diseases (59), as their size permits them to pierce interior spaces (60). The
                      particles produce toxic effects according to their chemical and physical properties. The
                      components of PM10 and PM2.5 can be organic (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, benzene,
                      1-3 butadiene) or inorganic (carbon, chlorides, nitrates, sulfates, metals) in nature (55).
                      Particulate Matter (PM) is divided into four main categories according to type and size (61)
                      (Table 2). TABLE 2 www.frontiersin.org Table 2. Types and sizes of particulate Matter (PM). Gas
                      contaminants include PM in aerial masses. Particulate contaminants include contaminants such as
                      smog, soot, tobacco smoke, oil smoke, fly ash, and cement dust. Biological Contaminants are
                      microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, mold, and bacterial spores), cat allergens, house dust
                      and allergens, and pollen. Types of Dust include suspended atmospheric dust, settling dust, and
                      heavy dust. Finally, another fact is that the half-lives of PM10 and PM2.5 particles in the
                      atmosphere is extended due to their tiny dimensions; this permits their long-lasting suspension
                      in the atmosphere and even their transfer and spread to distant destinations where people and
                      the environment may be exposed to the same magnitude of pollution (53). They are able to change
                      the nutrient balance in watery ecosystems, damage forests and crops, and acidify water bodies.
                      As stated, PM2.5, due to their tiny size, are causing more serious health effects. These
                      aforementioned fine particles are the main cause of the “haze” formation in different
                      metropolitan areas (12, 13, 61). Ozone Impact in the Atmosphere Ozone (O3) is a gas formed from
                      oxygen under high voltage electric discharge (62). It is a strong oxidant, 52% stronger than
                      chlorine. It arises in the stratosphere, but it could also arise following chain reactions of
                      photochemical smog in the troposphere (63). Ozone can travel to distant areas from its initial
                      source, moving with air masses (64). It is surprising that ozone levels over cities are low in
                      contrast to the increased amounts occuring in urban areas, which could become harmful for
                      cultures, forests, and vegetation (65) as it is reducing carbon assimilation (66). Ozone reduces
                      growth and yield (47, 48) and affects the plant microflora due to its antimicrobial capacity
                      (67, 68). In this regard, ozone acts upon other natural ecosystems, with microflora (69, 70) and
                      animal species changing their species composition (71). Ozone increases DNA damage in epidermal
                      keratinocytes and leads to impaired cellular function (72). Ground-level ozone (GLO) is
                      generated through a chemical reaction between oxides of nitrogen and VOCs emitted from natural
                      sources and/or following anthropogenic activities. Ozone uptake usually occurs by inhalation.
                      Ozone affects the upper layers of the skin and the tear ducts (73). A study of short-term
                      exposure of mice to high levels of ozone showed malondialdehyde formation in the upper skin
                      (epidermis) but also depletion in vitamins C and E. It is likely that ozone levels are not
                      interfering with the skin barrier function and integrity to predispose to skin disease (74). Due
                      to the low water-solubility of ozone, inhaled ozone has the capacity to penetrate deeply into
                      the lungs (75). Toxic effects induced by ozone are registered in urban areas all over the world,
                      causing biochemical, morphologic, functional, and immunological disorders (76). The European
                      project (APHEA2) focuses on the acute effects of ambient ozone concentrations on mortality (77).
                      Daily ozone concentrations compared to the daily number of deaths were reported from different
                      European cities for a 3-year period. During the warm period of the year, an observed increase in
                      ozone concentration was associated with an increase in the daily number of deaths (0.33%), in
                      the number of respiratory deaths (1.13%), and in the number of cardiovascular deaths (0.45%). No
                      effect was observed during wintertime. Carbon Monoxide (CO) Carbon monoxide is produced by
                      fossil fuel when combustion is incomplete. The symptoms of poisoning due to inhaling carbon
                      monoxide include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and, finally, loss of
                      consciousness. The affinity of carbon monoxide to hemoglobin is much greater than that of
                      oxygen. In this vein, serious poisoning may occur in people exposed to high levels of carbon
                      monoxide for a long period of time. Due to the loss of oxygen as a result of the competitive
                      binding of carbon monoxide, hypoxia, ischemia, and cardiovascular disease are observed. Carbon
                      monoxide affects the greenhouses gases that are tightly connected to global warming and climate.
                      This should lead to an increase in soil and water temperatures, and extreme weather conditions
                      or storms may occur (68). However, in laboratory and field experiments, it has been seen to
                      produce increased plant growth (78). Nitrogen Oxide (NO2) Nitrogen oxide is a traffic-related
                      pollutant, as it is emitted from automobile motor engines (79, 80). It is an irritant of the
                      respiratory system as it penetrates deep in the lung, inducing respiratory diseases, coughing,
                      wheezing, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and even pulmonary edema when inhaled at high levels. It seems
                      that concentrations over 0.2 ppm produce these adverse effects in humans, while concentrations
                      higher than 2.0 ppm affect T-lymphocytes, particularly the CD8+ cells and NK cells that produce
                      our immune response (81).It is reported that long-term exposure to high levels of nitrogen
                      dioxide can be responsible for chronic lung disease. Long-term exposure to NO2 can impair the
                      sense of smell (81). However, systems other than respiratory ones can be involved, as symptoms
                      such as eye, throat, and nose irritation have been registered (81). High levels of nitrogen
                      dioxide are deleterious to crops and vegetation, as they have been observed to reduce crop yield
                      and plant growth efficiency. Moreover, NO2 can reduce visibility and discolor fabrics (81).
                      Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Sulfur dioxide is a harmful gas that is emitted mainly from fossil fuel
                      consumption or industrial activities. The annual standard for SO2 is 0.03 ppm (82). It affects
                      human, animal, and plant life. Susceptible people as those with lung disease, old people, and
                      children, who present a higher risk of damage. The major health problems associated with sulfur
                      dioxide emissions in industrialized areas are respiratory irritation, bronchitis, mucus
                      production, and bronchospasm, as it is a sensory irritant and penetrates deep into the lung
                      converted into bisulfite and interacting with sensory receptors, causing bronchoconstriction.
                      Moreover, skin redness, damage to the eyes (lacrimation and corneal opacity) and mucous
                      membranes, and worsening of pre-existing cardiovascular disease have been observed (81).
                      Environmental adverse effects, such as acidification of soil and acid rain, seem to be
                      associated with sulfur dioxide emissions (83). Lead Lead is a heavy metal used in different
                      industrial plants and emitted from some petrol motor engines, batteries, radiators, waste
                      incinerators, and waste waters (84). Moreover, major sources of lead pollution in the air are
                      metals, ore, and piston-engine aircraft. Lead poisoning is a threat to public health due to its
                      deleterious effects upon humans, animals, and the environment, especially in the developing
                      countries. Exposure to lead can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption.
                      Trans- placental transport of lead was also reported, as lead passes through the placenta
                      unencumbered (85). The younger the fetus is, the more harmful the toxic effects. Lead toxicity
                      affects the fetal nervous system; edema or swelling of the brain is observed (86). Lead, when
                      inhaled, accumulates in the blood, soft tissue, liver, lung, bones, and cardiovascular, nervous,
                      and reproductive systems. Moreover, loss of concentration and memory, as well as muscle and
                      joint pain, were observed in adults (85, 86). Children and newborns (87) are extremely
                      susceptible even to minimal doses of lead, as it is a neurotoxicant and causes learning
                      disabilities, impairment of memory, hyperactivity, and even mental retardation. Elevated amounts
                      of lead in the environment are harmful to plants and crop growth. Neurological effects are
                      observed in vertebrates and animals in association with high lead levels (88). Polycyclic
                      Aromatic Hydrocarbons(PAHs) The distribution of PAHs is ubiquitous in the environment, as the
                      atmosphere is the most important means of their dispersal. They are found in coal and in tar
                      sediments. Moreover, they are generated through incomplete combustion of organic matter as in
                      the cases of forest fires, incineration, and engines (89). PAH compounds, such as benzopyrene,
                      acenaphthylene, anthracene, and fluoranthene are recognized as toxic, mutagenic, and
                      carcinogenic substances. They are an important risk factor for lung cancer (89). Volatile
                      Organic Compounds(VOCs) Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as toluene, benzene,
                      ethylbenzene, and xylene (90), have been found to be associated with cancer in humans (91). The
                      use of new products and materials has actually resulted in increased concentrations of VOCs.
                      VOCs pollute indoor air (90) and may have adverse effects on human health (91). Short-term and
                      long-term adverse effects on human health are observed. VOCs are responsible for indoor air
                      smells. Short-term exposure is found to cause irritation of eyes, nose, throat, and mucosal
                      membranes, while those of long duration exposure include toxic reactions (92). Predictable
                      assessment of the toxic effects of complex VOC mixtures is difficult to estimate, as these
                      pollutants can have synergic, antagonistic, or indifferent effects (91, 93). Dioxins Dioxins
                      originate from industrial processes but also come from natural processes, such as forest fires
                      and volcanic eruptions. They accumulate in foods such as meat and dairy products, fish and
                      shellfish, and especially in the fatty tissue of animals (94). Short-period exhibition to high
                      dioxin concentrations may result in dark spots and lesions on the skin (94). Long-term exposure
                      to dioxins can cause developmental problems, impairment of the immune, endocrine and nervous
                      systems, reproductive infertility, and cancer (94). Without any doubt, fossil fuel consumption
                      is responsible for a sizeable part of air contamination. This contamination may be
                      anthropogenic, as in agricultural and industrial processes or transportation, while
                      contamination from natural sources is also possible. Interestingly, it is of note that the air
                      quality standards established through the European Air Quality Directive are somewhat looser
                      than the WHO guidelines, which are stricter (95). Effect of Air Pollution on Health The most
                      common air pollutants are ground-level ozone and Particulates Matter (PM). Air pollution is
                      distinguished into two main types: Outdoor pollution is the ambient air pollution. Indoor
                      pollution is the pollution generated by household combustion of fuels. People exposed to high
                      concentrations of air pollutants experience disease symptoms and states of greater and lesser
                      seriousness. These effects are grouped into short- and long-term effects affecting health.
                      Susceptible populations that need to be aware of health protection measures include old people,
                      children, and people with diabetes and predisposing heart or lung disease, especially asthma. As
                      extensively stated previously, according to a recent epidemiological study from Harvard School
                      of Public Health, the relative magnitudes of the short- and long-term effects have not been
                      completely clarified (57) due to the different epidemiological methodologies and to the exposure
                      errors. New models are proposed for assessing short- and long-term human exposure data more
                      successfully (57). Thus, in the present section, we report the more common short- and long-term
                      health effects but also general concerns for both types of effects, as these effects are often
                      dependent on environmental conditions, dose, and individual susceptibility. Short-term effects
                      are temporary and range from simple discomfort, such as irritation of the eyes, nose, skin,
                      throat, wheezing, coughing and chest tightness, and breathing difficulties, to more serious
                      states, such as asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis, and lung and heart problems. Short-term exposure
                      to air pollution can also cause headaches, nausea, and dizziness. These problems can be
                      aggravated by extended long-term exposure to the pollutants, which is harmful to the
                      neurological, reproductive, and respiratory systems and causes cancer and even, rarely, deaths.
                      The long-term effects are chronic, lasting for years or the whole life and can even lead to
                      death. Furthermore, the toxicity of several air pollutants may also induce a variety of cancers
                      in the long term (96). As stated already, respiratory disorders are closely associated with the
                      inhalation of air pollutants. These pollutants will invade through the airways and will
                      accumulate at the cells. Damage to target cells should be related to the pollutant component
                      involved and its source and dose. Health effects are also closely dependent on country, area,
                      season, and time. An extended exposure duration to the pollutant should incline to long-term
                      health effects in relation also to the above factors. Particulate Matter (PMs), dust, benzene,
                      and O3 cause serious damage to the respiratory system (97). Moreover, there is a supplementary
                      risk in case of existing respiratory disease such as asthma (98). Long-term effects are more
                      frequent in people with a predisposing disease state. When the trachea is contaminated by
                      pollutants, voice alterations may be remarked after acute exposure. Chronic obstructive
                      pulmonary disease (COPD) may be induced following air pollution, increasing morbidity and
                      mortality (99). Long-term effects from traffic, industrial air pollution, and combustion of
                      fuels are the major factors for COPD risk (99). Multiple cardiovascular effects have been
                      observed after exposure to air pollutants (100). Changes occurred in blood cells after long-term
                      exposure may affect cardiac functionality. Coronary arteriosclerosis was reported following
                      long-term exposure to traffic emissions (101), while short-term exposure is related to
                      hypertension, stroke, myocardial infracts, and heart insufficiency. Ventricle hypertrophy is
                      reported to occur in humans after long-time exposure to nitrogen oxide (NO2) (102, 103).
                      Neurological effects have been observed in adults and children after extended-term exposure to
                      air pollutants. Psychological complications, autism, retinopathy, fetal growth, and low birth
                      weight seem to be related to long-term air pollution (83). The etiologic agent of the
                      neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) is not yet known, although it is
                      believed that extended exposure to air pollution seems to be a factor. Specifically, pesticides
                      and metals are cited as etiological factors, together with diet. The mechanisms in the
                      development of neurodegenerative disease include oxidative stress, protein aggregation,
                      inflammation, and mitochondrial impairment in neurons (104) (Figure 1). FIGURE 1
                      www.frontiersin.org Figure 1. Impact of air pollutants on the brain. Brain inflammation was
                      observed in dogs living in a highly polluted area in Mexico for a long period (105). In human
                      adults, markers of systemic inflammation (IL-6 and fibrinogen) were found to be increased as an
                      immediate response to PNC on the IL-6 level, possibly leading to the production of acute-phase
                      proteins (106). The progression of atherosclerosis and oxidative stress seem to be the
                      mechanisms involved in the neurological disturbances caused by long-term air pollution.
                      Inflammation comes secondary to the oxidative stress and seems to be involved in the impairment
                      of developmental maturation, affecting multiple organs (105, 107). Similarly, other factors seem
                      to be involved in the developmental maturation, which define the vulnerability to long-term air
                      pollution. These include birthweight, maternal smoking, genetic background and socioeconomic
                      environment, as well as education level. However, diet, starting from breast-feeding, is another
                      determinant factor. Diet is the main source of antioxidants, which play a key role in our
                      protection against air pollutants (108). Antioxidants are free radical scavengers and limit the
                      interaction of free radicals in the brain (108). Similarly, genetic background may result in a
                      differential susceptibility toward the oxidative stress pathway (60). For example, antioxidant
                      supplementation with vitamins C and E appears to modulate the effect of ozone in asthmatic
                      children homozygous for the GSTM1 null allele (61). Inflammatory cytokines released in the
                      periphery (e.g., respiratory epithelia) upregulate the innate immune Toll-like receptor 2. Such
                      activation and the subsequent events leading to neurodegeneration have recently been observed in
                      lung lavage in mice exposed to ambient Los Angeles (CA, USA) particulate matter (61). In
                      children, neurodevelopmental morbidities were observed after lead exposure. These children
                      developed aggressive and delinquent behavior, reduced intelligence, learning difficulties, and
                      hyperactivity (109). No level of lead exposure seems to be “safe,” and the scientific community
                      has asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reduce the current screening
                      guideline of 10 μg/dl (109). It is important to state that impact on the immune system, causing
                      dysfunction and neuroinflammation (104), is related to poor air quality. Yet, increases in serum
                      levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM) and the complement component C3 are observed (106). Another
                      issue is that antigen presentation is affected by air pollutants, as there is an upregulation of
                      costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 on macrophages (110). As is known, skin is our
                      shield against ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and other pollutants, as it is the most exterior
                      layer of our body. Traffic-related pollutants, such as PAHs, VOCs, oxides, and PM, may cause
                      pigmented spots on our skin (111). On the one hand, as already stated, when pollutants penetrate
                      through the skin or are inhaled, damage to the organs is observed, as some of these pollutants
                      are mutagenic and carcinogenic, and, specifically, they affect the liver and lung. On the other
                      hand, air pollutants (and those in the troposphere) reduce the adverse effects of ultraviolet
                      radiation UVR in polluted urban areas (111). Air pollutants absorbed by the human skin may
                      contribute to skin aging, psoriasis, acne, urticaria, eczema, and atopic dermatitis (111),
                      usually caused by exposure to oxides and photochemical smoke (111). Exposure to PM and cigarette
                      smoking act as skin-aging agents, causing spots, dyschromia, and wrinkles. Lastly, pollutants
                      have been associated with skin cancer (111). Higher morbidity is reported to fetuses and
                      children when exposed to the above dangers. Impairment in fetal growth, low birth weight, and
                      autism have been reported (112). Another exterior organ that may be affected is the eye.
                      Contamination usually comes from suspended pollutants and may result in asymptomatic eye
                      outcomes, irritation (112), retinopathy, or dry eye syndrome (113, 114). Environmental Impact of
                      Air Pollution Air pollution is harming not only human health but also the environment (115) in
                      which we live. The most important environmental effects are as follows. Acid rain is wet (rain,
                      fog, snow) or dry (particulates and gas) precipitation containing toxic amounts of nitric and
                      sulfuric acids. They are able to acidify the water and soil environments, damage trees and
                      plantations, and even damage buildings and outdoor sculptures, constructions, and statues. Haze
                      is produced when fine particles are dispersed in the air and reduce the transparency of the
                      atmosphere. It is caused by gas emissions in the air coming from industrial facilities, power
                      plants, automobiles, and trucks. Ozone, as discussed previously, occurs both at ground level and
                      in the upper level (stratosphere) of the Earth's atmosphere. Stratospheric ozone is protecting
                      us from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. In contrast, ground-level ozone is harmful to
                      human health and is a pollutant. Unfortunately, stratospheric ozone is gradually damaged by
                      ozone-depleting substances (i.e., chemicals, pesticides, and aerosols). If this protecting
                      stratospheric ozone layer is thinned, then UV radiation can reach our Earth, with harmful
                      effects for human life (skin cancer) (116) and crops (117). In plants, ozone penetrates through
                      the stomata, inducing them to close, which blocks CO2 transfer and induces a reduction in
                      photosynthesis (118). Global climate change is an important issue that concerns mankind. As is
                      known, the “greenhouse effect” keeps the Earth's temperature stable. Unhappily, anthropogenic
                      activities have destroyed this protecting temperature effect by producing large amounts of
                      greenhouse gases, and global warming is mounting, with harmful effects on human health, animals,
                      forests, wildlife, agriculture, and the water environment. A report states that global warming
                      is adding to the health risks of poor people (119). People living in poorly constructed
                      buildings in warm-climate countries are at high risk for heat-related health problems as
                      temperatures mount (119). Wildlife is burdened by toxic pollutants coming from the air, soil, or
                      the water ecosystem and, in this way, animals can develop health problems when exposed to high
                      levels of pollutants. Reproductive failure and birth effects have been reported. Eutrophication
                      is occurring when elevated concentrations of nutrients (especially nitrogen) stimulate the
                      blooming of aquatic algae, which can cause a disequilibration in the diversity of fish and their
                      deaths. Without a doubt, there is a critical concentration of pollution that an ecosystem can
                      tolerate without being destroyed, which is associated with the ecosystem's capacity to
                      neutralize acidity. The Canada Acid Rain Program established this load at 20 kg/ha/yr (120).
                      Hence, air pollution has deleterious effects on both soil and water (121). Concerning PM as an
                      air pollutant, its impact on crop yield and food productivity has been reported. Its impact on
                      watery bodies is associated with the survival of living organisms and fishes and their
                      productivity potential (121). An impairment in photosynthetic rhythm and metabolism is observed
                      in plants exposed to the effects of ozone (121). Sulfur and nitrogen oxides are involved in the
                      formation of acid rain and are harmful to plants and marine organisms. Last but not least, as
                      mentioned above, the toxicity associated with lead and other metals is the main threat to our
                      ecosystems (air, water, and soil) and living creatures (121). Discussion In 2018, during the
                      first WHO Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health, the WHO's General Director, Dr. Tedros
                      Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called air pollution a “silent public health emergency” and “the new
                      tobacco” (122). Undoubtedly, children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, especially
                      during their development. Air pollution has adverse effects on our lives in many different
                      respects. Diseases associated with air pollution have not only an important economic impact but
                      also a societal impact due to absences from productive work and school. Despite the difficulty
                      of eradicating the problem of anthropogenic environmental pollution, a successful solution could
                      be envisaged as a tight collaboration of authorities, bodies, and doctors to regularize the
                      situation. Governments should spread sufficient information and educate people and should
                      involve professionals in these issues so as to control the emergence of the problem
                      successfully. Technologies to reduce air pollution at the source must be established and should
                      be used in all industries and power plants. The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 set as a major target the
                      reduction of GHG emissions to below 5% by 2012 (123). This was followed by the Copenhagen
                      summit, 2009 (124), and then the Durban summit of 2011 (125), where it was decided to keep to
                      the same line of action. The Kyoto protocol and the subsequent ones were ratified by many
                      countries. Among the pioneers who adopted this important protocol for the world's environmental
                      and climate “health” was China (3). As is known, China is a fast-developing economy and its GDP
                      (Gross Domestic Product) is expected to be very high by 2050, which is defined as the year of
                      dissolution of the protocol for the decrease in gas emissions. A more recent international
                      agreement of crucial importance for climate change is the Paris Agreement of 2015, issued by the
                      UNFCCC (United Nations Climate Change Committee). This latest agreement was ratified by a
                      plethora of UN (United Nations) countries as well as the countries of the European Union (126).
                      In this vein, parties should promote actions and measures to enhance numerous aspects around the
                      subject. Boosting education, training, public awareness, and public participation are some of
                      the relevant actions for maximizing the opportunities to achieve the targets and goals on the
                      crucial matter of climate change and environmental pollution (126). Without any doubt,
                      technological improvements makes our world easier and it seems difficult to reduce the harmful
                      impact caused by gas emissions, we could limit its use by seeking reliable approaches.
                      Synopsizing, a global prevention policy should be designed in order to combat anthropogenic air
                      pollution as a complement to the correct handling of the adverse health effects associated with
                      air pollution. Sustainable development practices should be applied, together with information
                      coming from research in order to handle the problem effectively. At this point, international
                      cooperation in terms of research, development, administration policy, monitoring, and politics
                      is vital for effective pollution control. Legislation concerning air pollution must be aligned
                      and updated, and policy makers should propose the design of a powerful tool of environmental and
                      health protection. As a result, the main proposal of this essay is that we should focus on
                      fostering local structures to promote experience and practice and extrapolate these to the
                      international level through developing effective policies for sustainable management of
                      ecosystems.</p>

                    <img src="img/save-whater-2.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" alt="" />
                    <p>Water is the most valuable endowment of nature to people and other living creatures. Life on
                      Earth without water can’t be envisioned. Water that we utilize each day is freshwater and
                      establishes just 3% of the total water on Earth. This implies it is exceptionally uncommon and
                      ought not to be wasted by any means. The Earth’s freshwater reserve is getting drained each day at
                      a quick rate because of human exercises. Contamination and wastage of water are the most
                      significant purposes for its consumption. We can endure longer without food than without water. A
                      few plants can’t survive a day without water.



                      Water additionally supports a tremendous number of aquatic life. It is currently an ideal
                      opportunity to make a full move for protecting water and sparing it from annihilation. We should
                      make individuals increasingly mindful of water’s estimation and what damage we are doing by
                      wasting it. By enjoying persistent wastage of water, we set up a coffin for humankind and every
                      existing creature. Consistently the world draws nearer to a dry end while individuals like us
                      express ignorance. We realize that the arrangement lies in our own hands; however, we are not
                      ready to act quickly. It’s merely that we don’t understand how dreary a circumstance is, except if
                      we face it. It’s time that we should quit assessing and begin acting if we would prefer not to be
                      accused of making the planet dry and dead.</p>
